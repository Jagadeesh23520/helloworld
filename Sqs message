Perfect 👍 let’s break down your SQS listener config line by line.
You’ve set these values:

sqs.config.max.message: 10
sqs.config.max.poolsize: 5
sqs.config.wait.timeout: 3
sqs.config.core.poolsize: 3
sqs.config.queue.capacity: 5


---

🔹 1. sqs.config.max.message: 10

This means your listener can fetch up to 10 messages in a single poll from SQS.

AWS SQS ReceiveMessage API allows 1–10 messages per call.

✅ More messages per poll = fewer network calls → faster throughput.

⚠️ But it also means more tasks land in your executor at once.



---

🔹 2. sqs.config.core.poolsize: 3

At least 3 threads will always be alive to process messages.

First 3 messages → immediately processed in parallel.

These threads stay alive even if idle.



---

🔹 3. sqs.config.max.poolsize: 5

At most 5 threads can process messages simultaneously.

If 10 messages arrive:

First 3 → taken by core threads.

Next go to queue.

If queue fills, extra threads (up to 5 total) get created.




---

🔹 4. sqs.config.queue.capacity: 5

Executor can hold 5 waiting tasks while threads are busy.

Example:

10 messages polled.

3 threads busy.

5 messages queued.

2 extra threads (beyond core) start → total 5 running.

If 11th message arrives while all 5 busy and queue full → it’s rejected → SQS will re-deliver later (after visibility timeout).




---

🔹 5. sqs.config.wait.timeout: 3

This is the long polling wait time (seconds).

The listener waits up to 3 seconds for messages before returning.

If no messages arrive → empty response.

Longer wait (e.g., 10–20s) = fewer empty polls = cost efficient.

Short wait (3s) = faster “wake up”, but can waste API calls if traffic is low.



---

🔹 6. End-to-End Example (Your Config)

Poll SQS → get 10 messages.

Processing starts:

3 messages → immediately processed by core threads.

5 messages → held in queue.

2 more messages → new threads created (up to maxPoolSize = 5).


Now all 10 are in flight (3+2 running, 5 queued).

If more messages arrive before any finish → they’ll wait until threads free up or visibility timeout expires → then redelivered by SQS.



---

✅ Summary of Your Config

Parallelism: up to 5 messages processed at once.

Backlog buffer: 5 waiting messages max.

Batch fetch: 10 messages per poll.

Polling: listener waits 3s for new messages per poll.



---

👉 With this setup, throughput = ~5 messages * (your DB query time).
Since you said one message takes 10s in DB, maximum sustained throughput is ~30 messages per minute (5 parallel / 10s each).

⚡ Question for you: Do you want me to suggest an optimal config (pool, queue, max messages) for your case where DB takes ~10s per request, so you avoid backlog & deadlocks?
